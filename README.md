HWID Checker

Overview

This project provides a simple HWID (Hardware ID) checker that allows users to retrieve their unique system identifier. It includes two versions:
Executable (.exe) HWID Checker – A precompiled binary for ease of use.
Batch (.bat) HWID Checker – A script-based alternative for those who prefer to see the source code.

Features

Provides an .exe version for a quick and easy check.
Includes a .bat version for transparency and access to the source code.

Usage

Using the .exe HWID Checker
Download and run HWID_Checker.exe.
The program will display your HWID.
Copy the HWID if needed.
Using the .bat HWID Checker (Source Code Available)
Open HWID_Checker.bat in a text editor to review the code if desired.
Double-click HWID_Checker.bat to run it.
The command prompt will display your HWID.
Copy the HWID if needed.

Notes

Running the .exe version may trigger an antivirus warning due to the nature of HWID retrieval.
If you prefer transparency, use the .bat version to verify the code.
